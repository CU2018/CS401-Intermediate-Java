DONT WORK ON THE GUI UNTIL YOU GET YOUR ENTIRE PROGRAM EVERYTHING WORKING PERFECT 
FROM THE COMMAND LINE. 
BEFORE YOU SEARCH THE DICTIONARY OR DO HUERISTICS MAKE SURE YOUR WORD GENERATION
ALGORITHM IS CORRECT FIRST.

HERE IS A SKETCH OF HOW TO DO WRITE JUST ENOUGH TO VERIFY YOU ARE CORRECTLY GENERATING
ALL POSSIBLE WORDS FROM THE BOGGLE GRID.

Above main declare a static long int numWordsFormed=0;

In main do similar to swamp except instead of a single call to dfs
	// starting with EVERY letter of board, form all strings from it
	for every cell [r,c] in the boggle board
		call DFS(board, r,c, ""); 
	println numWordsFormed;

Below main write your DFS that only forms and counts wordsformed. 
Don't search dictionary or do hueristics until you have verified 
correctness of the words/count generated.

DFS( String[][] board, int r, int c, String word )
{
	tack the letter at [r][c] onto the end of your incoming word
	search dictionary for word
	if found 
		.add() it to a hits/matches set
		optionally while still debugging println the hit  println( word ); // you wont want to do this for grids >= 4
	else if not found
		see if the miss is not a prefix of any dictionary word (if not return)
			return //DONT FORM WORDS FROM THIS MISS PREFIX
	
	++numWordsFormed; //see it through the set .size()

	if NORTH's indices [r-1][c] are not out of bounds AND letter at [r-1][c] is unmarked
		mark the letter at r,c
		recurse passing in coords of N (relative to current r,c )
		unmark letter at r,c
	if NE ...
	if E  ...
	if SE ...
	if S  ...
	if SW ...
	if W  ...
	if NW ...
}

Before you begin, make sure you have a dictionary file named "dictionary.txt" in the same 
filefolder as this BoggleGUI.

When you open the file, there is a default 4x4 boggle board with alphabetical letters in each button.


1. If you don't have boggle files, just press "Randomize" for fun, and then if you want to solve
the randomized board, enter "4" in the text field named "DEFAULT DIMENSION: 4x4".

WARNING: IT CAN ONLY SOLVE RANDOMIZED 4X4-BOARD :=(  IF YOU WANT TO TEST RANDOMIZED 4X4-BOARD, MAKE 
SURE TEST IT BEFORE SOLVING A BOGGLE FILE :=)

2. If you want to solve a boggle, just enter the name of the file in the text field named "type 
boggle filename here", and then press "GO!" button.

WARNING: If the file does not have a number for declaring dimension of the board, please enter 
the dimension of the boggle board in the text field named "DEFAULT DIMENSION: 4x4" (You should 
enter a NUMBER, such as "4" or "5").
